**Jingwei Li (李经纬 in Chinese)** is a researcher of the School of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC). He joined UESTC in 2016. Before that, He was a postdoctoral researcher working with Professor [Patrick P. C. Lee](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~pclee/www/index.html) at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. During 2013 to 2014, he was a visiting scholar working with Prof. [Anna Squicciarini](https://ist.psu.edu/directory/acs20) at the Pennsylvania State University. He obtained the B.S. from Hebei University of Technology in 2009 and the Ph.D. (supervised by Prof. [Chunfu Jia](https://cc.nankai.edu.cn/2021/0323/c13619a548885/page.htm)) from Nankai University in 2014, respectively.

His research focuses on **data storage security**, which aims to improve the ubiquitous security of storage systems across various environments, such as blockchain, cloud computing, edge computing, and their combinations. Specifically, his research methodology emphasizes system design and implementation with two primary goals.

* Developing new storage systems: Extending the state-of-the-art designs by incorporating practical functionalities, such as security, fault tolerance, and space efficiency.

* Analyzing practical implications of theoretical results: Exploring how fundamental theoretical findings influence real-world systems and providing new insights to guide the design of secure storage systems.

A selected list of papers in storage and security is shown below.
